Analysis
    Based on the report in SOUTH FRANKLIN, VERMONT the "blue" lights gave it away
        Witness: C. O’Donnell
            Witness had a hard time talking about her experience. Seems to be unable to believe what she saw. Described an object
            similar to a jet fighter plane, of matte black color, with short wings, a horizontal propeller “similar to a drone” and
            emitting a faint blue light. Mentioned the object made no sound and was going “faster than any plane she ever saw”.
