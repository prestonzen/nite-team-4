South africa and Oslo are out since their meetings take place in September

The only meeting that will be in North America in June is Canada 

Domains in the report are:
    fsisac.com (F- SEA - SAC)
        "**PLEASE NOTE** This is a complimentary event hosted by FS-ISAC and is for FS-ISAC members only"
    formsite.com
        I think this was the site that was used to make the form for the game and isn't the domain we need.

Combine the reservation specifics with information
on the hosting companyâ€™s site to determine the
name of a device most likely to be connected to
the computer of a FS-ISAC representative.
Once the name of the device is known, our assets
on the ground will contact the hosting company,
rent the equipment, and implant malware. As soon
as the FS-ISAC representative uses the device, we
will gain access to their credentials.
